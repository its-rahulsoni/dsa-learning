Coding Pattern - 2 Pointers Approach

left pointer -> to store -ve nos to the left, and
right pointer -> to store +ve nos to the right.

Compare left and right pointer index values till both cross each other ....

Just like we compare 2 sorted arrays in Tim Sort using 2 Pointers.

UNION:-
Compare each element of both arrays and store smaller no in resultant array
and increment respective pointer. If both nos are equal, then increment
both the pointers.

At last, store all the elements of larger array that are left for processing.

INTERSECTION:-
We store only those numbers that are equal in both the arrays and increment
both pointers afterwards.

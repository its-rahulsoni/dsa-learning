### **Why Is `input.chars().mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` Needed?**
Let’s break this down clearly and explain why this specific transformation step is necessary to create a **stream of characters** for your solution, along with why it seems like **you can't create a Stream of `char` directly**.

---

### **1. `input.chars()` - What Does It Do?**

The `String.chars()` method returns an **IntStream** (a stream of integers) instead of a stream of characters. Each integer in this stream represents the **Unicode codepoint** (`int` value) of the corresponding character in the string.

For example:
```java
String input = "banana";
IntStream stream = input.chars(); 
```

The `stream` contains:
```
[98, 97, 110, 97, 110, 97]  // Unicode codepoints of 'b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a'.
```

This default behavior happens because:
- **Java does not have a Stream of `char` built-in.**
- Since primitive types (`char`, `int`, etc.) are not objects, Java uses specialized streams for primitives (e.g., `IntStream`, `DoubleStream`, `LongStream`) instead of `Stream<char>` to optimize for performance.

---

### **2. Why `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` Is Needed**
- To work with individual characters (`char`) as objects in the stream pipeline (like grouping by them or counting them), we need a `Stream<Character`>, not an `IntStream`.
- Therefore, we **map each integer codepoint (`int`) to its corresponding character (`char`)** using `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)`:
  ```java
  input.chars()
       .mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch);  // Converts IntStream to Stream<Character>
  ```

Here:
1. `input.chars()` produces an `IntStream` of Unicode integers.
2. `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` maps each integer to its corresponding `char` (`b`, `a`, `n`, ...).
3. Now, the resulting stream is a `Stream<Character`, which can directly work with `Collectors` and other stream operations.

---

### **Why Can't We Create a Stream of `char` Directly?**

Java does not provide a `Stream<char>` API. This is because:
1. **No Generic Streams for Primitives:**
    - Unlike objects (`Stream<T>`), primitives like `char` have specialized streams (`IntStream`, `DoubleStream`, etc.), which are designed for performance optimization.
    - Primitive streams (e.g., `IntStream`) are preferred because they avoid boxing/unboxing overhead for primitives.
2. **Boxing Primitives:**
    - To work with primitives like `char` as objects (e.g., `Character`), you need to convert them into their boxed equivalent (e.g., `Character`). This is achieved using `mapToObj` to "box" each `char`.

---

### Practical Example: Why `Stream<Character>` Is Preferred?

Let’s revisit your example:
```java
String input = "banana";

Map<Character, Long> output = input.chars()
                                   .mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)  // Converts IntStream to Stream<Character>
                                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                                       ch -> ch,   // Group by character
                                       Collectors.counting() // Count occurrences
                                   ));

System.out.println(output);
```

**What Happens:**
1. `input.chars()` produces `[98, 97, 110, 97, 110, 97]` (code points).
2. `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` converts those integers back to characters: `['b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a']`.
3. `Collectors.groupingBy` groups the characters (`b`, `a`, `n`) and counts their occurrences:  
   Output:
   ```
   {b=1, a=3, n=2}
   ```

### **Alternative Approaches to Work with Characters**

If you want to avoid directly using `input.chars()` and `mapToObj`, you can work with the string more intuitively using one of these methods:

---

#### **Approach 1: Using `toCharArray()`**
Convert the string to a character array and then create a stream of characters:
```java
Map<Character, Long> output = Arrays.stream(input.toCharArray())  // Converts input to Stream<char[]>
                                   .mapToObj(ch -> ch) // Convert each char to Character
                                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                                       ch -> ch,
                                       Collectors.counting()
                                   ));
System.out.println(output);
```

**Explanation:**
- `toCharArray()` gives you an array of `char`s: `['b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a']`.
- The `Arrays.stream()` method operates on arrays but still requires boxing via `mapToObj`.

---

#### **Approach 2: Splitting String into Individual Characters**
Use `split("")` to split the string into individual characters, then manipulate them as a stream:
```java
Map<String, Long> output = Arrays.stream(input.split("")) // Splits string into ["b", "a", "n", "a", "n", "a"]
                                 .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                                     ch -> ch,
                                     Collectors.counting()
                                 ));
System.out.println(output);
```

**Output:**
```java
{b=1, a=3, n=2}
```

**Explanation:**
- `split("")` splits the string into individual character strings, resulting in `["b", "a", "n", "a", "n", "a"]`.
- No need for `mapToObj`, since the resulting elements are already `String` objects (not primitives).

---

#### **Approach 3: Iterating Over Characters Using `String.codePoints()`**
Use `String#codePoints`, which works similarly to `chars()` but supports larger Unicode codepoints:
```java
Map<Character, Long> output = input.codePoints()
                                   .mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)
                                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                                       ch -> ch,
                                       Collectors.counting()
                                   ));
```

This works the same way as `input.chars()`, but it handles Unicode characters above the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

### **Why Java Doesn’t Have `Stream<char>`?**

The absence of `Stream<char>` is tied to **design decisions in Java**:
1. **Performance Concerns:**
    - Using primitive-specific streams (`IntStream`) avoids overhead from boxing/unboxing operations.
2. **Stream API Is Object-Oriented:**
    - Streams are designed for **object processing** (`Stream<T>`), and primitives like `char` are treated differently.
3. **Consistency Across Java Primitives:**
    - For uniformity, Java uses **IntStream**, **LongStream**, and **DoubleStream** for primitives. Since `char` is essentially a numeric value (its `int` codepoint), it’s grouped with `IntStream`.

---

### **Why Mapping (`mapToObj`) Is Ideal?**

To work with a `Stream<Character>` (a boxed `char` type):
1. **Boxing the Primitive:**  
   Java needs to convert `char` from primitive to `Character` to operate as an object.
2. **Handling Unicode Codepoints Properly:**  
   `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` ensures the conversion and avoids accidental mismatch.

Thus, `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` is the bridge between primitive `char` streams (`IntStream`) and object-oriented streams (`Stream<Character>`).

---

### **Conclusion**

You cannot directly create a `Stream<char>` because Java’s `Stream` API operates either on objects (`Stream<T>`) or primitives (`IntStream`, `DoubleStream`, etc.).

For `input.chars()`:
- `mapToObj(ch -> (char) ch)` is required to transform an `IntStream` (code points) into a `Stream<Character>` for easier processing.

Alternative approaches like `toCharArray()` or `split("")` exist but have their own nuances. **Use `mapToObj` when working with streams directly from `input.chars()` for maximum clarity and efficiency.**

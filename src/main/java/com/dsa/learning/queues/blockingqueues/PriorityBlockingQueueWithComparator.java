/**
 * The PriorityBlockingQueue is a thread-safe priority queue provided in the java.util.concurrent package in Java.
 * It is designed for use in concurrent scenarios and is especially useful when multiple threads need to access
 * and process elements based on priority.
 *
 * Blocking Nature:
 * Unlike PriorityQueue, it does not block waiting for elements when the queue is empty.
 * In PriorityBlockingQueue, if the queue is empty, poll() will simply return null instead of blocking,
 * and if it's full (though it's unbounded), producers wonâ€™t be blocked because it grows dynamically.
 * Instead, consumers must handle the null return for operations like poll().
